<i>Koine Greek Working Papers in Linguistics</i> is an annual publication of squibs, essays, and preprint research in Ancient Greek linguistics. We welcome contributions that examine post-Classical Greek grammar and lexicon, often (but not necessarily) published as articles on the site Koine-Greek.com before being compiled together each year. Our interests for publication include book reviews, full length articles, squibs, or commentary on the field and its scholarship generally.

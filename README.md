<i>Working Papers in Post-classical Greek</i> is an annual publication of squibs, essays, and preprint research in Ancient Greek linguistics. We welcome contributions that examine post-Classical Greek grammar and lexicon, often (but not necessarily) published as articles on the site Koine-Greek.com before being compiled together each year. Our interests for publication include book reviews, full length articles, squibs, or commentary on the field and its scholarship generally.

Often Working Papers in Linguistics publications are produced by individual institutions, particularly unviersity linguistics departments. However, because of the distributive nature of scholars and students working in post-Classical Greek linguistics across so many different schools and institutions, our goal is to promote the study of linguistics and post-classical Greek regardless of geography. Many contributions come from the small handful of websites dedicated to Post-classical Greek langauge, such as Koine-Greek.com and ThePatrologist.com.
